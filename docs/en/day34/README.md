# Sticking On Felt
Today we make another step towards the end goal. Today we stick on the felt on the tool This means we're getting closer to the polishing phase. What's important with sticking on the felt on the tool is that the felt is asymetric to prevent patterns. To prevent symetry we just lay the felt on the tool.

When we're happy with how the felt is fitting on the tool we start to stick it on the tool. The felt is fitted with glue on the backside similar to a sticker. We cover the whole surface of the tool and make sure the edges of the felt don't touch eachother. The felt that is sticking over the edge of the tool will get cut away.

As soon as all the felt is on the tool we put the mirror on top along with an extra weight to make sure the felt sticks good.

The mirror looks like this now.

After we checked that everything is fine I continue with grinding, again with three micron grit which effectively is 1.5 micron grit because of the felt. The felt also acts as insure, the chance of getting a scratch is minimized.

Grinding with felt is a whole new experience again and it feels great. In the beginning it's important to add grit and to wet the felt because the felt isn't drenched yet.

After about 30 minutes of grinding I checked the mirror and and pits are getting smaller again. Till next time!
