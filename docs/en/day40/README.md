# More Correcting
Today Johnny and I are alone and both can polish. Johnny has his 20cm F5 and made himself a new pitch slab but needs to press it a bit to get the shape to fit his mirror.

I start with cleaning and then start with polishing with the tool on top. I do tool on top because of the edges and because the mirror is a little too deep. I use very short strokes to correct the edges and a bit longer straight strokes (1/3) to correct for the deepness. I also apply some figure eights to keep the shape correct.

After about 1.5 hours we start to measure. We haven't done this ourselves to it's hard to find the right spot. Eventually we found it and this is the image I got from my mirror:

On this image you can see the hooks at the top of the lines which are getting shorter, which means the edge is getting better. What we also can see is that I over corrected the overall surface with the longer strokes. The lines are no longer hourglass shaped but are pointing into the other direction.

Next time I probably have to make more longer strokes to correct for the edge and I think mirror on top to correct for the over correction. Untill the next time!
