# Pleasant Grinding
Today was a great day. The last time I found a couple of small pits that I need to grind away, nothing to worry about though. Last time I was grinding with five micron powder so I will continue with that. I grinded for about thirty minutes with the mirror on top of the tool and then I grinded with the tool on top of the mirror for around thirty minutes.

After the hour I went to clean everything and inspect the mirror. I went from left to right, bottom to top, diagonally and at some random places but everywhere it looked the same which is good. I also let Bram inspect the mirror and Johnny also watched for a bit and both found that I did a good job.

To be sure I went to clean both mirror and tool again while Bram was making a new solution with three micron powder. With that I grinded for about half an hour untill I ran out of time and started to clean everything again.

Now that the mirror is starting to shine, Bram and Johnny wanted to see if they could see the reflection of the light and determine the focal length. I small bright light went on and the big lighting went off and while Johnny held the mirror we tried to find a blob of reflected light. Unfortunately we didn't find the reflection but did when we made the mirror wet. The distance from the mirror to the most concentrated light was about 2.8m which means a focal length of 1.4m. 1.4m divided by 25cm is f/5.6 which is exactly what I'm after at.

Till next time where I will continue with three micron powder.
