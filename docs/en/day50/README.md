Today I'll continue with making the mirror spherical. So we will do the same as always, we make sure that everything is clean and then we can continue with polishing. I again use straight strokes with about 1/3 overlap.

After about an hour we noticed I progressed only slightly so Bram suggested to make a new, smaller, tool. So we found an alluminum disc of about 7cm to put the pitch on to reduce the bump in the middle of the mirror.
