# Flat Back
This evening I expected to correct the mirror, instead I made the back of the more flat. The back of the mirror was already quite flat but not entirely when measured with a spherometer. Because the mirror is hollow and the tool is spherical it is a little harder. You can ease this by using two sheets of bubble wrap and a piece of anti slip. In the middle of one of the sheets of bubble wrap the bubbles are popped so that the weight is evenly distributed.

The grinding was done in two wets, of course the back of the mirror on the back of the tool. When the two wets are done the mirror is put on the bottom and the tool on top. This repeats. After about an hour of grinding with powder 180 we did a measure and it was almost perfect. Bram suggested to make a figure eight. I did that for about three of four times and then the back of both mirror and tool were perfectly flat.

After making the back flat, there was still time to correct the mirror. This time with powder 180 and just as with making the back flat, I used the figure eight to correct the mirror. Next to that I also put a little less pressure on the mirror. Quite quick I could hear and feel it was getting better. After about three or four wets I ran out of time and we measured again. The mirror is perfectly spherical again.

We also looked at the the back and mirror surface to see if we can move to the next powder. We could see it's not complete even yet. It's better to continue next time with powder 180 to save about half an hour when moving to the next powder.

Till next week!
