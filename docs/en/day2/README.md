# Flattening
October 28th was the second time I went to grind. Johny and Rudy were there as well. I started right away when I arrived and grind for about two hours. This time they recommended me to flip the blank and tool regulary, so tool on top and blank on top. This switching makes sure the back of the blank is flat and stays flat. If we don't switch the blank and tool regularly the piece that's on top would get concaved and the other part spherical.

I've grinded the whole evening with powder 320. We cleaned the glass regularly and I got several tips and tricks to remove the blank/tool from the blank/tool. Removing the top piece didn't go well all the time but I'm getting better at it each and every time.

Last week the grind part was about 10cm wide, at the end of this night it was about 18cm. It now takes a while to make more progress because more material needs to be removed. It's important that the back of the blank is completely dull/dim/mat to make sure the back is completely flat. Becuase there's more surface area now the grinding powder loses its grinding abilities quicker now so adding more powder now is key. I now can hear better when the powder doesn't grind anymore as well.

At the end of the evening we again cleaned everything nicely for the next time and we went home.
