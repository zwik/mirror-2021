# The Second Milestone
Tonight I hope I will be at the right depth, so let's get started! Last time I went a bit too far in the center so my strokes need to be about one to two centimeter shorter. After about 45 minutes we measured. Another error, now the sides are a bit too high.

Bram suggested to put the tool on top. This feels weird because the tool is convex and the mirror concave. After about 5 minutes we measured again and we can see it getting better. Another five minutes with the tool on top and then measure again. This time we measure 2,9mm wich is just a little too deep but the saggita is 0,110 and I need to reach 0,111 with is about perfect. So the focal length is now correct so it's done for tonight!

Next time I will use powder 120.
