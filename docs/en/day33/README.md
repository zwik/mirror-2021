# Three Micron Done
Last time there were still a couple of small pits left so today I continued with three micron powder. Johnny made me a new solution after which I started grinding two wets with the tool on top of the mirror. After that I did two wets with the mirror on top of the tool. At the end I heard some peeping so i stopped immediately. While doing the inspection I couldn't find anything wrong. Johnny told me this sometimes happens with the mirror is perfectly spherical, so lets assume that's true! The pits we saw last time were also gone.

Next time I will probably work with felt. Till next time!
