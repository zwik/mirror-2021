# Ronchi
Today I'm going to polish! The strokes are the same as with grinding, till about 1/3 over the tool and instead of grit we use cerium oxide that we replace regularly with some water and we turn the regularly together with some figure eights. Today I'll polish with the mirror on top.

I did this the whole evening and at the end we tested the mirror with a Ronchi test. When looking at the Ronchi image we saw and hourglass shape. This means the mirror isn't spherical and a little too deep. I need to fix that the next time by polishing with the tool on top.
