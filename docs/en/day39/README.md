# Correcting
Today I shall try to correcit the mirror according to the Ronchi we saw last week. I will do this by polishing with the tool on top. As soon as I started I felt that something was off and I let Bram have a look. Bram agreed that the shape was indeed not correct and suggested to do figure eights untill the shape was good again.

I did correct the shape for about half an hour untill it got better. After that I used straight strokes again. I used the straight strokes for about 10 minutes and then turned everything around and used the mirror on top again for another 10 minutes.

When I was done we tested the mirror with a Ronchi test. We noticed that the mirror isn't corrected yet but also noticed a dropped off edge. I can fix that by using very short strokes and turn regularly. I did that for about an hour.

After I was done with the short strokes we tested the mirror again and noticed that it got better. There's still a dropped off edge and the mirror still isn't spherical but it's going into the right direction. You can see the dropped off edge because of the little hooks at the end of the lines that point outwards. Because the lines aren't straight you can tell the mirror isn't spherical yet. Below you can find a picture of how it currectly looks.
