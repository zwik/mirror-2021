# This Feels Strange
Today I continued polishing. Before I actually start polishing I clean my work area and mirror and tool. After about an hour of polishing I feel something is off. When moving from one side it goes easier than moving back. To be sure nothing is wrong we test the mirror to see if I made an error somewhere. Thankfully we don't see any errors on the mirror but we do see something on the tool. But nothing of great impact! On the tool we make little scratches with a saw blade to speed up the polishing process. It seemed that most of these scratches were gone so I just need to make new ones.
