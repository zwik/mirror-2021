# Going Deeper
Last time I ended on 0,7mm like shown here:

Today I wanted to shave off an extra 1mm and get to 1,7mm, that went a little different. Again it was a nice bunch and I started my grinding. I used the same stroke as last week again. Everything went well, even with a bit of chatting but it was getting harder every time. Until after about an hour of grinding I was too tired. My arms didn't want to go anymore! Bram was outside playing with his astrophotography setup so I started to clean up. While grinding it looks like this:

After I cleaned everything up I tried to measure myself. According to my measuments I got to 1mm, but because I'm not sure how Bram is measuring I waiting for him instead.

By putting a vernier caliper on top of the mirror you can clearly see that the mirror is becomming hollow. But how much?

Bram entered and measured the mirror. He also measured 1mm. With the spherometer and that looked a bit off. With my 3rd stroke, so right strokes I made them too long and too little. So I need to adjust that next time by doing shorter strokes and grind more often. Of course we also updated the sheet:

The goals was 1mm, in the end I only grinded off 0,3mm. That was a bit of a bummer but nothing to worry about.
