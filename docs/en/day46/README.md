# A Little Too Far
Polishing today felt good but during testen it seemed my strokes were too long. Because of that I pushed the edge away. You can seen this on the Ronchi because there's hooks on the lines:

To resolve this I scratched away the edges on the pitch. After about an half hour of polishing this is the result on the Ronchi:

You can see wel that I'm working on the center now.
