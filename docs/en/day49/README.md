# Back To Spherical
Before I can continue with polishing I need to make sure that everything is clean. I clean the table and make sure the pitch is clean as well by brushing it off with a brush that is only used with pitch under running water and of course I clean up up the mirror as well. After everything is clean I can start polishing.

Last time I was I was done with correcting the edge. Today I will try to make mirror spherical again. I will do this straight strokes untill 1/3 till the edge. I did this for a good hour to then measure again. When measuring It looked already better but I'm not there yet. So I need to continue next week.

Bram and Johnny said they will renew the pitch on the tool the coming days. The current pitch is worn out and you can see that because the grooves between the pitch is gone.
