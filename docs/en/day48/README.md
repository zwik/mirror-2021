# Edge Corrected
Last time I corrected the mirror almost till the edge. To get to the edge I need to continue correcting today. I still make short strokes of about 1cm with a W-stroke. I did this for about an hour and then tested the mirror.

After I put the mirror on the test bench I put the Ronchi behind the focus point. Here it was mostly visible that I created a bulge in the center of the mirror, this is the result of the short strokes. By removing the Ronchi grid it was clearly visible that I corrected till the edge which is good. I can now make the mirror spherical again which means removing the bulge.

Before I can start making the mirror spherical again I need to work the pitch by adding the scratches. The pitch is good enough to make mirror spherical again. When the mirror is spherical again I need to poor a new pitch slab to start the parabolizing process.
