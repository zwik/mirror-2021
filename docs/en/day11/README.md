# Another Correction
With good hope I started hogging out the mirror. After an hour of grinding it was time to measure again. The measure was done correctly but I hardly made any progress, that's odd. Now that I can put on pressure better you could assume I would have made better progress. I suggested to do another pencil test to see what the erors are. It seemed I grind too much on the edges again instead of the whole surface. Why is that? It seemed that my strokes are too short. With the center of the mirror I should go more to the edge of the tool and then everything should correct itself. Now that I watch this more closely I could see the powder between the two pieces of glass touch more surface and thus the problem is getting resolved. Eventually I only grinded away 0,1mm.
