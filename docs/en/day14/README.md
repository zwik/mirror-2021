# Finder Grinding
Now that I'm at depth it's time to use a finer powder. This time I will use powder 120 and will do two wets and then I will switch the mirror and tool so that the tool will be on top. I will repeat this process about an hour. Grinding with a finder powder produces a lot less noise! It's harder to hear when the powder is done, and you can feel it a little less as well.

After an hour of grinding and switching the mirror and tool it's time to measure, but first I need to clean. After cleaning the mirror we measured that I'm not deep enough. This is because powder 80 produces not very accurated results because there are many "holes int he glass. This isn't a problem because I'm still very close to the desired focal length.

Because the surface looks pretty good and I need to go a little deeper, Bram suggests to now only put the mirror on top and don't switch the tool anymore, I will do this for about half an hour.

After half an hour it is time to measure again and we noticed the center had become less deep, my strokes were too long so I need to correct this the next time. We also noticed some deeper "holes". It could be that the powder isn't 120 only.

I will continue next time!
