# Is It Flat?
![Beginning Day 3](/images/IMG_2624.jpg)
This is how the mirror looks at the beginning of the evening. At the edges there is still a little drop but we should be able to have corrected that at the end of the evening. I've started with powder 320, just like the previous times.

After several rounds of grinding it was time to clean up. After we cleaned the mirror and tool we started to measure with a spherometer to determine how much more I need to grind before the mirror is flat. The spheremeter notice there was quite a difference on the edges which is not good. We put on the side of a large caliper and started measuring with measuring strips. We were off by over half a milimeter, which is quite a lot. Too much to grind away with powder 320. We also measured the other side of the mirror of which we thought it was less flat. Here we noticed the same but just a little less.

We decided to start grinding with powder 80 on both sides of the mirror to check which side will be flat first. Two times on one side of the mirror, than two times on the other side of the mirror. After that we turn tool so we stay flat and repeat this for about ten times. Powder 80 makes a lot more noise compared to powder 320! This we this for about three times and in between we measured to see if we're getting the right effect.

At the end of the evening the mirror was more flat compared to when we started, i've become wizer. As we such in Dutch: "meten is weten", which freely translated to "measuring is knowing'. The side we started on with powder 320 seems a bit less flat that we initially thought compared to the other side. Next week we shall see which side will be flat first.
