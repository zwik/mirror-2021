# Correction Of The Curve
Today Yigal came along to watch and give his opinion but of course also because it's nice. Like I wrote last time the mirror is not spherical. This is because I've grinded most on the sides. Today I will correct this by making more straight strokes. Bram said I could just start and he will correct me if I do something that is off. That correcting happened of course within the next moment by telling I should make more straight strokes. After the first powder I cleaned up the glass and put on new powder so Bram could feel. He made a couple of strokes and then let me feel and describe what he felt. By doing the straight stroke more slowly you can feel a couple of bumps or areas where you can feel a bit more resistance. This means the mirror is not spherical and this can be solved by doing more straight strokes. This will grind away those bumps. Bram advised me to make three strokes left, three strokes left and then ten straight strokes and so I went.

After that everything went smooth sailing, I cleaned the glass regularly and didn't work too long on the powder, the glass needs to be removed (broken) and not the powder which means you need to push quite hard. In the meanwhile we chatted and Yigal showed his design of a telescope he is working on. Also both Johnny and Yigal grinded away bit on the mirror. Yigal also did the pencil test which of course was fine.

Towards the end of the evening it's mandatory to measure. This evening I brought my own digital vernier caliper. This reads a bit easure compared to an analog one because you can easily null this one. We measured 1,2mm and Bram had a go as well. Bram worked on it for five minutes and we then measured 1,3mm! Bram is pushing much harder which I can't do.

After Bram was done I want to grind away just as much, so we put a couple of planks on the floor so that I stand a bit higher so that I can put on a bit more force The turntable is relatively hight for me so I can't put as much force on compared to Bram because he's just a tad taller than me. On the planks I'm standing about 4cm higher which makes a lot of difference. After about 10-15 minutes I stopped, cleaned the mirror and measured again. This time it was just over 1,4mm so we wrote down 1,4mm on the sheet. I'm now about half way hogging out.

To be continued next week!
