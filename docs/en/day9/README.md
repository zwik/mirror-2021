# Pain
This evening Yigal came along again and helped me here and there. I continued where I left of last week, this means hogging out with the same stroke. After a couple of wets I added a new facet on both tool and mirror and Yigal helped me with that.

After adding the facet I continued grinding but after a while I got pain in my right hand because my hand is flat on the mirror and I push as hard as I can. After a while I could not even put my hands in my pockets anymore and couldn't bend my hand back, that was the moment Johnny took over from me.

Eventually I grinded to 2,0mm.
