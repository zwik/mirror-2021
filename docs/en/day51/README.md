# Small Pitch Slag
Last week we started with pouring a new small pitch slab. When I arrived today I noticed this small pitch slab was gone and the plan now is to make a new small pitch slab with a new mold. This new mold is made of isolation material and this has small bubbles which should help in the polishing process.

As soon as the new pitch slag is cooled down I can start by removing the small bump in the centre of the mirror. In the centere of the mirror I make figure eights with the small pitch slab. After about fifteen minutes of polishing we measure with a Ronchi test.

The bump in the centre seems to be still be very present. After another polishing session of about twenty minutes we test again.

We can see it marginally improved. Bram suggested to make a slightly larger pitch slag. Till next week!
