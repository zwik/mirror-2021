# Continue With 180 And Inspection
Tonight wasn't very spectacular, I've been busy with grinding with powder 180 on the back and mirror side. Mostly doing straight strokes with an occasional figure eight in between to keep the shape correct.

At the end I did an inspection with a 30x magnification to see if the surface was grinded equally. Unfortunately I was still able to find too many pits coming from rougher grits. So next week I'll continue fixing that and add a new facet.
