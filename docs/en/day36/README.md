# 2000!
Today I will start with grit 2000. This is the last grit before polishing. Bram and Johnny already removed the old felt from the tool and replaced it with blue felt. The main difference between the white felt from the last time next to the color is that this blue felt is much softer.

Because Bram and Johnny prepared everything I can start continue with grinding right away. At the end of the evening I inspected the mirror and noticed that in the center of the mirror there's barely structure left. This already looks a bit like polishing! I didn't notice any other abnomalities.
