# Last Pit
Last time there was still a small pit visible that needs to be removed, so that's todays task. Today I grind figure eights and straight strokes with grit 320.

As usual I don't add presure but use the weight of the mirror/tool to grind away. After every two wets I'll check if the pit got away or is getting smaller. If the pit is smaller I'll turn around the mirror/tool and continue.

After checking three times Johnny suggested to put a bit of pressure on to speed up the process. After two wets again I checked and saw the following:

I grinded another two wets and these are the results:

Unfortunately the pit is still not away but it is getting smaller. Johnny mentioned I will be working on this next time again to grind it away. No worries, see you next time!
