# Finally Flat
![Beginning Day 4](/images/IMG_2660.jpg)
In the beginning of the evening the mirror looked like that. I started off with powder 80. The tool I only used on one side but regularly switched tool and mirror on top. Every time three times grinding, and then switch mirror and tool. I did this for about three times and then we cleaned and measured. Every time we saw the edges were getting more flat, from 0.3mm slowly to 0.01mm.

Bram noticed that my W-stroke was not centric meaning the mirror and tool were not entirely flat. We solved this by putting small blocks before and behind the mirror. When your stroke is now too far the blocks will fall of the turn table, you need to stay between the blocks and don't touch them. This way you learn quickly how far you need to go. The mirror and tool were then flat again fairly quick. Instead of a W-stroke we used a regular stroke, five strokes, turn, five strokes, turn, etc. untill the powder is done. This five times and then switch mirror and tool again.

At the end of the evening the backside of the mirror was finally totally flat, with powder 80. I need to grind away a bit more with finder powders untill powder 320.

The other side of the mirror is also almost flat and now looks like this:

Next week we'll finish that and start hogging out.
