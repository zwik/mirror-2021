# Started Hogging
![Flat Blank](/images/IMG_2728.jpg)
This is how the blank looks when I started the evening. Nice and flat! At the end of the evening this will different but it's hard to tell on a picture. Another thing that's already hardly noticable on the picture is the missing facet. This is grinded totally away while flattening the blank. Because I start with hogging out the blank this evening, I need to start by adding a new facet to both blank and tool. I do this with a diamont spunge. I've spend about an hour adding the new facets under running water.

After adding the facet I can start hogging. How deep do I need to go? Bram created a nice sheet:

I figured that the telescope will be on the ground and that I want to look comfortably. The focal length at F6 seems a bit long, the focal length at F5.6 seems perfect. According to the sheet I need to go to 2.7902mm.

And now I can really start! First straight strokes, No W-stroke like previous times. When the powder was done which happens fairly quick. Then Bram showed me another more riscier stroke but is a bit faster when hogging. After Bram showed me two times I did the rest. The stroke is moving the mirror to the side of tool turn the mirror a bit and then on the right side of the tool, then turn mirror and tool and repeat. I do this two times with new powder, the third time is just straight stroke. I repeat these three strokes.

In between powders we measure with the dial gauge and we measured we went down, 0.1mm. Another 20 minutes and we measure again, now it is 0.2mm - 0.3mm. That goes pretty fast. At the end of the evening I ended up with 0.5mm.

This evening I spend about an hour hogging out. Normally I spend about two hours per evening. So in about two weeks I should be around done with hogging out. I don't know what's coming after that but I'm already looking forward!
