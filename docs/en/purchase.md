# Buying A Blank

For a while now I'm walking around with the idea to make a nice little travel dobson. I love the travel dobsons made by Roel that I wanted to make one myself one day. Next to that it's nice to have such a compact design to take with you on a holiday and enjoy the local night sky.

In the beginning of 2021 I found a mirror blank for 95 Euro via a local astronmy website. I've collected this mirror on March 6 with my friend Yigal. The guy apparently needed to get rid of a couple of items because I received a nice marble tool along with it.

Later from the same friend I received another two blanks together with some jars of grinding powder, and a great book. That should be all I need to create a nice mirror from this blank!
