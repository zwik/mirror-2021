# Almost There
The evening started quiet where we left last week. This time I didnt' want to make any errors so I went slow and steady and watch my strokes. This means the strokes shouldn't be too short and the mirror should reach to the edge of the tool.

This time I brought my digital vernier caliper, the last couple of times I forgot to bring it with me. This reads a little easier and we don't need to calculate anymore. After about an hour of grinding we measured 2,6mm which is about 0,2mm deeper than last time! Good progress and the mirror now still is nicely spherical.

After about three quarters of an hour we measured again. This time we started with the spherometer and we noticed I went a bit too far on the center of the mirror! In the center of the mirror the focal lenght is a bit too short to my liking. I can correct this by doing shorter strokes next time. The vernier caliper showed me that I was shy over 2,7mm with means I'm almost there! The goal is 2,7907mm so only just a couple of hundreds and some correction and I'm there.

I'm looking forward to next week already!
