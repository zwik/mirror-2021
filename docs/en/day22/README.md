# Pit Gone
Today I'll continue with grit 320 to remove the last pit. I did three wets and checked in between if the pit was gone. After three wets the pit still wasn't gone. During inspection we found another pit but this was just touching the surface. After another three wets the surface was clean again.

Because there was plenty of time left I decided the clean everything and start with a finer grit. Usually this would be grit 500 but because this grit comes from another supplier which works with micrometers we've decided to got with a grit size of 15 micrometer because it's comparable with grit 500.

After I cleaned everything thoroughly I started with the 15 micrometer grit. The biggest difference with this grit is that I don't distribute it over the tool but mix it with glycerine. Glycerine helps to make the mirror and tool not stick together. It is now very important to apply new grit and lubricant when the lubricant runs out to prevent the mirror and tool sticking together because it would be imposible to seperate them again. After cleaning I've roughly thirty minutes left.

After half an hour of grinding I clean up everything again and have a look at the result. The mirror looks great after only half an hour of grinding. We only found four small pits which should be easily be removed next time. Next time I should even be able to again start with an even finer grit. See you next week!
