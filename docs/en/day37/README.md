# Creating A Pitch Slab
Today is a great day because I can start with the next stage, polishing. Before I can start polishing we need to create a pitch slab. The pitch will be poured into a mold as pictured here.

What you can see as well is that we created a container of paper so that if we spill the pitch it can't go all over the place. In the container we've put the mirror on a flat surface with on top a piece of news paper and the mold. When the mold is exactly in the center of the mirror we can start pouring the warm pitch into the mold

When the pitch fills up the mold nicely we can put the tool in the pitch. The tool then rests there for about an hour.

As soon as the pitch is hard enough we can remove the mold and we can remove the overflowing edges of pitch from the tool.

The pitch slab is almost ready now. We put on some cerium oxide on the mirror, wet it and distribute it evenly. The tool will be put on the mirror so that will the get a tight fit. We repeat the process a couple of times. Also notice that the cerium oxide will get into the pitch

When the shape is good we put scratches into the pitch with a saw blade, this will speed up the polishing process.

There was even some time left for some polishing, this is a quick result.

I'm already looking forward for the next session!
