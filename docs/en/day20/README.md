# Grit 320
Today I will start grinding with a new grit, grit 320 to be exact. To keep the spherical shape I will make different shapes: figure eights, w-strokes and straight strokes.

After four wets I will clean everything and I'll check the surface for small pits. The surface looks really great but i've found a couple of small pits that are too large and should be removed. To correct these pits Bram suggets I do anotther two wets to make them disappear.

After two wets we'll inspect the surface again but we found a larger pit where a bit of glass came lose. Bram removed this piece with a small drill and we mark the back of the mirror so we can find the pit again. Again I'll do two wets to see if the pit is gone. After cleaning up we'll inspect again but the small pit is not entirely gone but it is almost.

Unfortunately today's time is up, so I'll continue next time!
