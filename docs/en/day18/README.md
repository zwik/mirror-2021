# Finished 180
Today I started with putting on a new facet, first with a rough tool of I think grit 120 and after that grit 200. I added the facet on both the front and back side of both mirror and tool.

After that I continued with grit 180, this went well but I forget to do some figure eight moves, this means that I lost the shape a bit but I can correct this easily and fast the next time.

After that I check with the magnification glass and everything looks great now. Next time I can probabaly start with a finer grit.
