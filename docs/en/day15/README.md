# Small Break

Here we are again! I couldn't grind for about a month due to Covid, but here we are again. Together with Johny I started today with powder 120. Last time the center seemed a bit deeper, we shall correct this next week.

Like stated above I started with powder 120. I had to get used to it again but if feld good quite soon. After grinding for about an hour we measured with the spherometer and the mirror looked perfect there. Good news! So I continued with powder 120 until the end of the evening. When the evening was almost over I felt that it was getting harder to move the tool over the center of the mirror. We measured with the spherometer and a pencil test and that was correct, I guess I need to correct that next week.

We also checked the mirror fysically with some kind of magnification glass and the mirror is now equally grinded on the center and the sides. I think I can start using a finder powder next week.
