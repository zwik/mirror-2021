# A Step Back
Today it was nice and quiet again so I could work nicely with five micron powder. I grinded for about one and a half hour and then checked if everything was fine. At first sight everything did look fine but then I discovered a small pit but there were more pits in a line. Unfortunately these pits were too big for the current powder so in consultation with Bram I went back two powder to 15 micron. I worked with this powder for about half an hour and then checked again to see if the pits were gone. The pits indeed were gone after this small period of time and the rest of the surface also looked fine again. I then started to clean everything and put everything away.
