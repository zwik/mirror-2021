# A Scratch
That was the first thing I heard, "There's a scratch on your mirror". I was shocked en looked at the mirror. There's quite a scratch indeed. What will we do? If I continue polishing the scratch won't be removed, the smaller ones probably will but not the big one. I probably won't notice while observing so I choose not to go back to griding. Here's a picture of the scratch, the scratch can be located in the white square.

The rest of the evening I've been polishing to get the shape back. I had to to strokes with about 1/4 of overhang with the mirror on top. I did this for about an hour and then measured with Ronchi again. This looked like this:

The lines are straight finally straight now and there's also no error anymore on the edge. Next time I can continue polishing again.
