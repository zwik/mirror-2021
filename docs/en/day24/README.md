# Scratch Removal
Last week I made a scratch so this week I will replace the cork with shorter versions so I definetly can't touch the cork. After assembly I started again with the 15 micron solution. After about 30 minutes I checked if the scratch was gone and indeed, the scratch was gone.

At the edge there were still a couple of small pits so I continued with the same solution untill the end of the evening. At the end of the evening I checked again and everything looked perfect. Next week I can start with a another powder.
